"about uveitis. IS THE UVEITIS, AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE?","Uveitis: Uveitis is swelling and irritation of the uvea. The uvea is the middle layer of the eye. The uvea provides most of the blood supply to the retina. Uveitis can be caused by autoimmune disorders. These diseases occur when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. Examples are: - Ankylosing spondylitis - Psoriasis - Reactive arthritis - Rheumatoid arthritis - Sarcoidosis - Ulcerative colitis Uveitis can also be caused by infections such as: - AIDS - Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis - Herpes zoster infection - Histoplasmosis - Kawasaki disease - Syphilis - Toxoplasmosis - Tuberculosis Exposure to toxins or injury can also cause uveitis. In many cases, the cause is unknown. The most common form of uveitis involves inflammation the front part of the eye. It is often called iritis because it most often only affects the iris. The iris is the colored part of the eye. In most cases, it occurs in healthy people. The disorder may affect only one eye. It is most common in young and middle-aged people. Posterior uveitis affects the back part of the eye. It involves primarily the choroid. This is the layer of blood vessels and connective tissue in the middle layer of the eye. This type of uveitis is called choroiditis. If the retina is also involved, it is called chorioretinitis. Another form of uveitis is pars planitis. Changes involve the narrowed area (pars plana) between the colored part of the eye (iris) and the choroid. Pars planitis most often occurs in young men. It is generally not associated with any other disease. However, it may be linked to Crohn disease and possibly multiple sclerosis. Uveitis can affect one or both eyes. Symptoms may develop rapidly and can include: - Blurred vision - Dark, floating spots in the vision - Eye pain - Redness of the eye - Sensitivity to light The health care provider will take a complete medical history and do an eye exam. Lab tests may be done to rule out infection or a weak immune system. If you are over age 25 and have pars planitis, your provider will suggest a brain and spine MRI. This will rule out multiple sclerosis. Iritis (anterior uveitis) is most often mild. Treatment may involve: - Dark glasses - Eye drops that dilate the pupil to relieve pain - Steroid eye drops Pars planitis is often treated with steroid eye drops. Other medicines, including steroids taken by mouth, may be used to help suppress the immune system. Posterior uveitis treatment depends on the underlying cause. It almost always includes steroids taken by mouth. If the uveitis is caused by a body-wide (systemic) infection, you may be given antibiotics. You may also be given powerful anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids. With proper treatment, most attacks of anterior uveitis go away in a few days to weeks. However, the problem often returns. Posterior uveitis may last from months to years. It may cause permanent vision damage, even with treatment. Complications may include: - Cataracts - Fluid within the retina - Glaucoma - Irregular pupil - Retinal detachment - Vision loss Symptoms that need urgent medical care are: - Eye pain - Reduced vision If you have a body-wide (systemic) infection or disease, treating the condition will prevent uveitis.

Editorial team.","Uveitis is a complex, heterogeneous group of inflammatory diseases affecting the uveal tract, which comprises the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. While the pathogenesis of uveitis is multifactorial, an autoimmune component is implicated in a significant proportion of cases.

Autoimmune uveitis is characterized by an aberrant immune response, where the body's immune system mistakenly targets the uveal tract, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. This can occur in isolation or in association with systemic autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and sarcoidosis.

Several lines of evidence support the role of autoimmunity in uveitis:

1. **Association with HLA antigens**: Certain HLA antigens, such as HLA-B27 and HLA-B51, are strongly associated with specific types of uveitis, suggesting a genetic predisposition to autoimmune uveitis.
2. **Presence of autoantibodies**: Autoantibodies against uveal antigens, such as retinal S-antigen and interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein, have been detected in patients with uveitis.
3. **Immunohistochemical findings**: Immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated the presence of immune cells, including T cells and macrophages, in the uveal tract of patients with uveitis.
4. **Response to immunosuppressive therapy**: Patients with autoimmune uveitis often respond well to immunosuppressive therapy, such as corticosteroids and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which further supports the autoimmune nature of the disease.

However, not all cases of uveitis are autoimmune in origin. Other causes of uveitis include:

1. **Infectious agents**: Bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections can cause uveitis.
2. **Trauma**: Traumatic injury to the eye can lead to uveitis.
3. **Malignancies**: Certain malignancies, such as lymphoma and leukemia, can cause uveitis.
4. **Sarcoidosis**: Sarcoidosis, a systemic granulomatous disease, can cause uveitis.

In conclusion, while not all cases of uveitis are autoimmune in nature, a significant proportion of cases have an autoimmune component. A thorough diagnostic evaluation, including a comprehensive medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, is essential to determine the underlying cause of uveitis and guide treatment.

 Treatment options for autoimmune uveitis include:

1. **Corticosteroids**: Topical, periocular, or systemic corticosteroids can be used to control inflammation.
2. **Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)**: DMARDs, such as methotrexate and azathioprine, can be used to reduce inflammation and prevent recurrences.
3. **Biologic agents**: Biologic agents, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors, can be used to treat severe or refractory cases of autoimmune uveitis.
4. **Immunosuppressive therapy**: Immunosuppressive therapy, such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, can be used to control inflammation and prevent recurrences.

It is essential to note that treatment should be individualized based on the underlying cause of uveitis, disease severity, and patient response to therapy.",9.0
"achalasia. after surgery for achalasia, will spasms continue in the upper chest area and if so what can assist in ending spasms","Gastroesophageal reflux - discharge (Drug Treatment): Antacids can help neutralize your stomach acid. They do not help to treat the irritation in your esophagus. Common side effects of antacids include diarrhea or constipation. Other over-the-counter drugs and prescription drugs can treat GERD. They work more slowly than antacids but give you longer relief. Your provider can tell you how to take these drugs. There are two different types of these drugs: H2 antagonists: famotidine (Pepcid), cimetidine (Tagamet), ranitidine (Zantac), and nizatidine (Axid) Proton pump inhibitors (PPI): omeprazole (Prilosec or Zegarid), esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), dexlansoprazole (Dexilant), rabeprazole (AcipHex), and pantoprazole (Protonix)","Achalasia is a primary esophageal motility disorder characterized by the failure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to relax, resulting in dysphagia, regurgitation, and chest pain. Surgical interventions, including Heller myotomy and peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM), aim to alleviate symptoms by disrupting the abnormal muscle contractions.

Postoperative esophageal spasms in the upper chest area, also known as chest tightness or discomfort, can occur in some patients with achalasia. The incidence of postoperative spasms varies, with studies reporting a range of 10-40%. The etiology of these spasms is multifactorial and may be attributed to:

1. Residual esophageal spasm: Despite surgical intervention, some patients may experience persistent esophageal spasm, which can cause chest discomfort.
2. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): Surgical disruption of the LES can lead to increased reflux, causing chest symptoms.
3. Esophageal hypersensitivity: Some patients may develop heightened sensitivity to esophageal distension, resulting in chest pain or discomfort.

To manage postoperative esophageal spasms, several treatment options can be considered:

1. **Nitrates**: Short-acting nitrates, such as isosorbide dinitrate, can help relax the esophageal smooth muscle and alleviate spasms.
2. **Calcium channel blockers**: Medications like nifedipine or diltiazem can reduce esophageal spasm by inhibiting calcium influx into smooth muscle cells.
3. **Antacids or acid reducers**: For patients with concomitant GERD, antacids or acid reducers like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can help alleviate chest symptoms.
4. **Prokinetic agents**: Medications like metoclopramide or domperidone can enhance esophageal motility and reduce symptoms.
5. **Dietary modifications**: Avoiding trigger foods, eating smaller meals, and adopting a low-fat diet may help alleviate symptoms.
6. **Endoscopic dilation**: For patients with persistent dysphagia or esophageal narrowing, endoscopic dilation can help improve esophageal patency.
7. **Pneumatic dilation**: This procedure involves using a balloon to dilate the LES and can be effective in alleviating symptoms in some patients.

In addition to these treatment options, several considerations should be taken into account when managing postoperative esophageal spasms:

1. **Surgical technique**: The type of surgical procedure performed may influence the likelihood of postoperative spasms. For example, POEM may be associated with a lower incidence of spasms compared to Heller myotomy.
2. **Disease severity**: Patients with more severe achalasia may be more likely to experience postoperative spasms.
3. **Patient expectations**: Managing patient expectations and providing education on potential postoperative outcomes can help mitigate anxiety and improve patient satisfaction.

In conclusion, postoperative esophageal spasms can occur in patients with achalasia, and a multifaceted approach to management is often necessary. A combination of pharmacological interventions, dietary modifications, and endoscopic procedures can help alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life.",9.0
"Ankle injury. I got hurt in my left leg ankle almost 5 months ago. I went to doctor, got x-ray, where no damage was found. He suggested me some pain killers and advised me to wear anklet. I have been following the instruction since then; I went to another doctor who advised me to go for physiotherapy (Short Wave Diathermy) and advised me some exercises. I have been following them too. But yet now, I have not been fully recovered from the pain. Especially when I try to walk quickly or try to put pressure with my left leg, I feel pain. I am very tensed about this. Can you please suggest me how to overcome the pain. Thanks.","Earache (Causes): The eustachian tube runs from the middle part of each ear to the back of the throat. This tube drains fluid that is made in the middle ear. If the eustachian tube becomes blocked, fluid can build up. This may lead to pressure behind the eardrum or an ear infection. Ear pain in adults is less likely to be from an ear infection. Pain that you feel in the ear may be coming from another place, such as your teeth, the joint in your jaw (temporomandibular joint), or your throat. This is called ""referred"" pain. Causes of ear pain may include: Arthritis of the jaw Short-term ear infection Long-term ear infection Ear injury from pressure changes (from high altitudes and other causes) Object stuck in the ear or buildup of ear wax Hole in the eardrum Sinus infection Sore throat Temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ) Tooth infection Ear pain in a child or infant may be due to infection. Other causes may include: Ear canal irritation from cotton-tipped swabs Soap or shampoo staying in the ear","**Chronic Ankle Pain Following Trauma: A Review of Management Options**

The persistence of ankle pain despite initial treatment and physiotherapy warrants a comprehensive reassessment of the injury and consideration of further diagnostic testing.

Given the initial X-ray findings were negative for fractures, the differential diagnosis may include soft tissue injuries, such as ligament sprains, muscle strains, or tendinopathies. The mechanism of injury, severity of symptoms, and response to treatment should be re-evaluated.

The current treatment regimen, consisting of pain killers and an anklet, may be supplemented with additional modalities to address chronic pain and promote healing. Physiotherapy, including Short Wave Diathermy (SWD), has been appropriately initiated. SWD is a form of electromagnetic therapy that can enhance tissue repair and reduce inflammation.

However, the persistence of pain with weight-bearing activities and rapid gait suggests that underlying structural or biomechanical issues may not have been adequately addressed. Consideration should be given to the following diagnostic and therapeutic options:

1. **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**: To evaluate for soft tissue injuries, such as ligament sprains or tendinopathies, which may not be visible on X-ray.
2. **Ankle instability assessment**: To determine if chronic instability is contributing to pain and functional impairment.
3. **Gait analysis**: To assess biomechanical abnormalities that may be exacerbating pain and to guide orthotic or shoe modifications.
4. **Additional physiotherapy modalities**: Such as ultrasound, laser therapy, or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections, which may enhance tissue repair and reduce inflammation.
5. **Strengthening and proprioception exercises**: To improve ankle stability and reduce pain.
6. **Orthotics or shoe modifications**: To reduce stress on the affected ankle and promote healing.
7. **Pain management alternatives**: Such as corticosteroid injections or oral medications, which may be considered if pain is severe and debilitating.

In light of the chronic nature of the pain, a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating orthopedic, physiotherapy, and pain management expertise, may be beneficial in achieving optimal outcomes.

It is essential to re-evaluate the ankle injury and develop a comprehensive treatment plan to address the underlying causes of chronic pain and functional impairment. A thorough diagnostic workup, combined with a tailored treatment approach, can help alleviate symptoms and promote optimal recovery.",9.0

Me and My mom have tried so many things to get rid of these bugs and they just don't go away were the family that takes 2 showers and now about 3 showers a day we never understood how they could have infected us but I was just wondering is washing our clothes the best bet to get rid of these things, because apparently it hasn't worked for us. So is there any suggestions?","Head lice (Causes): Head lice infect hair on the head. Tiny eggs on the hair look like flakes of dandruff. However, instead of flaking off the scalp, they stay in place. Head lice can live up to 30 days on a human. Their eggs can live for more than 2 weeks. Head lice spread easily, particularly among school children. Head lice are more common in close, overcrowded living conditions. You can get head lice if: You come in close contact with a person who has lice. You touch the clothing or bedding of someone who has lice. You share hats, towels, brushes, or combs of someone who has lice. Having head lice causes intense itching but does not lead to serious medical problems. Unlike body lice, head lice never carry or spread diseases. Having head lice does NOT mean the person has poor hygiene or low social status.","Body Lice (Pediculus humanus corporis) Infestation: Treatment and Eradication Strategies

Body lice infestations can be challenging to eliminate, particularly when treatment measures are inadequate or incomplete. Given your situation, where multiple daily showers have not resolved the issue, it is essential to re-examine your treatment approach.

**Clothing and Laundry**

Washing clothes is a crucial step in eliminating body lice, but it appears that your current laundry practices have not been effective. To improve this, consider the following:

Please help me out as to whom to consult for anxiety and depression,"Drug allergies (Drug allergies, Allergic reaction - drug (medication) , Drug hypersensitivity , Medication hypersensitivity): Drug allergies are a group of symptoms caused by an allergic reaction to a drug (medicine). A drug allergy involves an immune response in the body that produces an allergic reaction to a medicine. The first time you take the medicine, you may have no problems. But, your body's immune system may produce a substance (antibody) against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the antibody may tell your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine. Histamines and other chemicals cause your allergy symptoms. Common allergy-causing drugs include: Drugs used to treat seizures Insulin (especially animal sources of insulin) Substances containing iodine, such as x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions) Penicillin and related antibiotics Sulfa drugs Most side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction. For example, aspirin can cause hives or trigger asthma without involving the immune system. Many people confuse an unpleasant, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a drug allergy. Most drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. These symptoms may occur right away or hours after receiving the drug. Serum sickness is a delayed type of drug allergy that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medicine or vaccine. Common symptoms of a drug allergy include: Hives Itching of the skin or eyes (common) Skin rash (common) Swelling of the lips, tongue, or face Wheezing Symptoms of anaphylaxis include: Abdominal pain or cramping Confusion Diarrhea Difficulty breathing with wheezing or hoarse voice Dizziness Fainting, lightheadedness Hives over different parts of the body Nausea, vomiting Rapid pulse Sensation of feeling the heart beat (palpitations) An examination may show: Decreased blood pressure Hives Rash Swelling of the lips, face, or tongue (angioedema) Wheezing Skin testing may help diagnose an allergy to penicillin-type medicines. There are no good skin or blood tests to help diagnose other drug allergies. If you have had allergy-like symptoms after taking a medicine or receiving contrast (dye) before getting an x-ray, your health care provider will often tell you that this is proof of a drug allergy. You do not need more testing. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent a severe reaction. Treatment may include: Antihistamines to relieve mild symptoms such as rash, hives, and itching Bronchodilators such as albuterol to reduce asthma-like symptoms (moderate wheezing or cough) Corticosteroids applied to the skin, given by mouth, or given through a vein (intravenously) Epinephrine by injection to treat anaphylaxis The offending medicine and similar drugs should be avoided. Make sure all your providers -- including dentists and hospital staff -- know about any drug allergies that you or your children have. In some cases, a penicillin (or other drug) allergy responds to desensitization. This treatment involves being given very small doses at first, followed by larger and larger doses of a medicine to improve your tolerance of the drug. This process should be done only by an allergist, when there is no alternative drug for you to take. Most drug allergies respond to treatment. But sometimes, they can lead to severe asthma, anaphylaxis, or death. Call your provider if you are taking a medicine and seem to be having a reaction to it. Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have difficulty breathing or develop other symptoms of severe asthma or anaphylaxis. These are emergency conditions. There is generally no way to prevent a drug allergy. If you have a known drug allergy, avoiding the drug is the best way to prevent an allergic reaction. You may also be told to avoid similar medicines. In some cases, a provider may approve the use of a drug that causes an allergy if you are first treated with medicines that slow or block the immune response. These include corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and antihistamines. Do not try this without a provider's supervision. Pretreatment with corticosteroids and antihistamines has been shown to prevent allergic reactions in people who need to get x-ray contrast dye. Your provider may also recommend desensitization.

A milk product allergy is an adverse immune reaction to one of the proteins in milk, typically casein or whey. This condition can manifest with varying degrees of severity, from mild symptoms to life-threatening anaphylaxis. While there is no definitive ""cure"" for milk product allergy, several management strategies and treatment options are available to alleviate symptoms and prevent severe reactions.

**Avoidance and Dietary Management**

The primary approach to managing a milk product allergy is strict avoidance of milk-containing products. This involves reading food labels carefully and asking questions about food ingredients when eating outside the home. A registered dietitian can help create a personalized meal plan that ensures adequate nutrition while avoiding milk products.

**Emergency Treatment and Anaphylaxis Management**

For individuals with a history of severe reactions, it is essential to have an emergency plan in place. This includes carrying an EpiPen or other epinephrine injector and knowing how to use it. Antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, may also be prescribed for mild to moderate reactions.

**Immunotherapy and Desensitization**

Oral immunotherapy (OIT) is a treatment approach that involves gradually increasing exposure to small amounts of milk to build tolerance. While OIT has shown promise in some studies, it is not widely available, and its long-term efficacy is still being researched.

**Research and Emerging Therapies**

Several ongoing clinical trials are investigating new treatments for milk product allergy, including:

1. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT): This involves placing a small amount of milk protein under the tongue to build tolerance.
2. Anti-IgE therapy: This approach targets the IgE antibodies responsible for triggering allergic reactions.
3. Probiotics and prebiotics: Research suggests that certain probiotics and prebiotics may have immunomodulatory effects, potentially reducing allergy symptoms.

**Current Research and Future Directions**

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other organizations are actively funding research to develop new treatments for milk product allergy. While these emerging therapies hold promise, it is essential to note that their efficacy and safety have not yet been fully established.

**Recommendations and Considerations**

For individuals with a milk product allergy, it is crucial to:

1. Consult with a healthcare provider to develop a personalized treatment plan.
2. Carry an EpiPen or other epinephrine injector, if prescribed.
3. Read food labels carefully to avoid accidental exposure.
4. Consider working with a registered dietitian to ensure adequate nutrition.

While there is currently no definitive ""cure"" for milk product allergy, ongoing research and emerging therapies offer hope for improved management and potential desensitization.

Locked-in syndrome (LIS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by complete paralysis of all voluntary muscles except for the eyes, resulting in a state of near-total immobility. The condition is often caused by damage to the brainstem, typically due to traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke, or hemorrhage.

**Current Management and Treatment Options:**

1. **Respiratory care**: Patients with LIS often require mechanical ventilation to support breathing. A tracheotomy may be necessary to facilitate long-term ventilation management.
2. **Nutritional support**: Patients may require enteral nutrition through a gastrostomy tube to maintain adequate nutrition and hydration.
3. **Pain management**: Chronic pain is a common comorbidity in LIS patients. A multidisciplinary approach, including pharmacological interventions (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin) and alternative therapies (e.g., acupuncture, massage), may be employed to manage pain.
4. **Rehabilitation and physical therapy**: Although limited by paralysis, patients with LIS can benefit from regular physical therapy to prevent contractures, maintain joint mobility, and promote skin integrity.
5. **Communication and cognitive support**: Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies, such as eye-tracking systems or blink-coded communication, can facilitate interaction and expression.

**Emerging Therapies and Research Directions:**

1. **Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)**: BCIs are being explored as a potential means of restoring communication and control in LIS patients. These systems use electroencephalography (EEG) or other techniques to decode brain activity, allowing patients to interact with their environment.
2. **Stem cell therapies**: Researchers are investigating the use of stem cells to repair damaged brain tissue and promote neuroregeneration in LIS patients.
3. **Pharmacological interventions**: Novel pharmacological agents, such as those targeting the brain's default mode network, are being explored as potential therapeutic options for LIS.

**Considerations for Martinique-Based Care:**

1. **Access to specialized care**: Patients with LIS require access to multidisciplinary teams with expertise in neurology, pulmonology, rehabilitation medicine, and pain management. In Martinique, patients may need to be referred to larger medical centers or specialized rehabilitation facilities.
2. **Equipment and supply availability**: Ensuring access to necessary medical equipment, such as ventilators and AAC devices, is crucial for optimal care.
3. **Family and caregiver support**: Family and caregivers play a vital role in supporting patients with LIS. Access to counseling, education, and respite care can help mitigate caregiver burden.

Best Regards","IMH » Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (Treatment and Therapies): While there is no cure for ADHD, currently available treatments can help reduce symptoms and improve functioning. Treatments include medication, psychotherapy, education or training, or a combination of treatments. Medication For many people, ADHD medications reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity and improve their ability to focus, work, and learn. Medication also may improve physical coordination. Sometimes several different medications or dosages must be tried before finding the right one that works for a particular person. Anyone taking medications must be monitored closely and carefully by their prescribing doctor. Stimulants. The most common type of medication used for treating ADHD is called a ""stimulant."" Although it may seem unusual to treat ADHD with a medication that is considered a stimulant, it works because it increases the brain chemicals dopamine and norepinephrine, which play essential roles in thinking and attention. Under medical supervision, stimulant medications are considered safe. However, there are risks and side effects, especially when misused or taken in excess of the prescribed dose.For example, stimulants can raise blood pressure and heart rate and increase anxiety. Therefore, a person with other health problems, including high blood pressure, seizures, heart disease, glaucoma, liver or kidney disease, or an anxiety disorder should tell their doctor before taking a stimulant. Talk with a doctor if you see any of these side effects while taking stimulants: decreased appetite sleep problems tics (sudden, repetitive movements or sounds); personality changes increased anxiety and irritability stomachaches headaches Non-stimulants. A few other ADHD medications are non-stimulants. These medications take longer to start working than stimulants, but can also improve focus, attention, and impulsivity in a person with ADHD. Doctors may prescribe a non-stimulant: when a person has bothersome side effects from stimulants; when a stimulant was not effective; or in combination with a stimulant to increase effectiveness. Although not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically for the treatment of ADHD, some antidepressants are sometimes used alone or in combination with a stimulant to treat ADHD. Antidepressants may help all of the symptoms of ADHD and can be prescribed if a patient has bothersome side effects from stimulants. Antidepressants can be helpful in combination with stimulants if a patient also has another condition, such as an anxiety disorder, depression, or another mood disorder. Doctors and patients can work together to find the best medication, dose, or medication combination. Learn the basics about stimulants and other mental health medications on the NIMH Mental Health Medications webpage and check the FDAwebsite (http://www.fda.gov/), for the latest information on warnings, patient medication guides, or newly approved medications. Psychotherapy Adding psychotherapy to treat ADHD can help patients and their families to better cope with everyday problems. Behavioral therapy is a type of psychotherapy that aims to help a person change his or her behavior. It might involve practical assistance, such as help organizing tasks or completing schoolwork, or working through emotionally difficult events. Behavioral therapy also teaches a person how to: monitor his or her own behavior give oneself praise or rewards for acting in a desired way, such as controlling anger or thinking before acting Parents, teachers, and family members also can give positive or negative feedback for certain behaviors and help establish clear rules, chore lists, and other structured routines to help a person control his or her behavior. Therapists may also teach children social skills, such as how to wait their turn, share toys, ask for help, or respond to teasing. Learning to read facial expressions and the tone of voice in others, and how to respond appropriately can also be part of social skills training. Cognitive behavioral therapy can also teach a person mindfulness techniques, or meditation. A person learns how to be aware and accepting of one's own thoughts and feelings to improve focus and concentration. The therapist also encourages the person with ADHD to adjust to the life changes that come with treatment, such as thinking before acting, or resisting the urge to take unnecessary risks. Family and marital therapy can help family members and spouses find better ways to handle disruptive behaviors, to encourage behavior changes, and improve interactions with the patient. For more information on psychotherapy, see the Psychotherapies webpage on the NIMH website. Education and Training Children and adults with ADHD need guidance and understanding from their parents, families, and teachers to reach their full potential and to succeed. For school-age children, frustration, blame, and anger may have built up within a family before a child is diagnosed. Parents and children may need special help to overcome negative feelings. Mental health professionals can educate parents about ADHD and how it affects a family. They also will help the child and his or her parents develop new skills, attitudes, and ways of relating to each other. Parenting skills training (behavioral parent management training) teaches parents the skills they need to encourage and reward positive behaviors in their children. It helps parents learn how to use a system of rewards and consequences to change a child's behavior. Parents are taught to give immediate and positive feedback for behaviors they want to encourage, and ignore or redirect behaviors that they want to discourage. They may also learn to structure situations in ways that support desired behavior. Stress management techniques can benefit parents of children with ADHD by increasing their ability to deal with frustration so that they can respond calmly to their child's behavior. Support groups can help parents and families connect with others who have similar problems and concerns. Groups often meet regularly to share frustrations and successes, to exchange information about recommended specialists and strategies, and to talk with experts. Tips to Help Kids and Adults with ADHD Stay Organized For Kids: Parents and teachers can help kids with ADHD stay organized and follow directions with tools such as: Keeping a routine and a schedule. Keep the same routine every day, from wake-up time to bedtime. Include times for homework, outdoor play, and indoor activities. Keep the schedule on the refrigerator or on a bulletin board in the kitchen. Write changes on the schedule as far in advance as possible. Organizing everyday items. Have a place for everything, and keep everything in its place. This includes clothing, backpacks, and toys. Using homework and notebook organizers. Use organizers for school material and supplies. Stress to your child the importance of writing down assignments and bringing home the necessary books. Being clear and consistent. Children with ADHD need consistent rules they can understand and follow. Giving praise or rewards when rules are followed. Children with ADHD often receive and expect criticism. Look for good behavior, and praise it. For Adults: A professional counselor or therapist can help an adult with ADHD learn how to organize his or her life with tools such as: Keeping routines Making lists for different tasks and activities Using a calendar for scheduling events Using reminder notes Assigning a special place for keys, bills, and paperwork Breaking down large tasks into more manageable, smaller steps so that completing each part of the task provides a sense of accomplishment.","**Leigh Disease and EPI-743 Treatment: Clinical Considerations and Potential Options**

Leigh disease is a rare, inherited mitochondrial disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, often resulting in severe morbidity and mortality. The presence of a family history, as in this case, significantly increases the risk of transmission to offspring. Given the early stage of the disease in the 4-month-old son, timely intervention is crucial to potentially alter the disease course.

EPI-743 (Vincerine) is a para-benzoquinone derivative, which has been investigated as a potential therapeutic agent for various mitochondrial disorders, including Leigh disease. Its mechanism of action involves the modulation of mitochondrial function, specifically targeting the electron transport chain to increase energy production and reduce oxidative stress.

**Clinical Evidence and Treatment Considerations:**

Several case reports and small-scale studies have demonstrated the potential efficacy of EPI-743 in improving symptoms and slowing disease progression in patients with Leigh disease. However, it is essential to note that these findings are preliminary and require further validation through larger, controlled clinical trials.

A 2011 case series published in the journal _Molecular Genetics and Metabolism_ reported improved clinical outcomes in 5 patients with Leigh disease treated with EPI-743. Another study published in 2018 in the _Journal of Medical Genetics_ demonstrated significant improvements in neurological function and quality of life in 12 patients with mitochondrial disorders, including Leigh disease, treated with EPI-743.

**Potential Treatment Options and Considerations:**

1. **EPI-743 Clinical Trials:** Participation in a clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of EPI-743 in patients with Leigh disease may be a viable option for the affected son. Researchers and clinicians can provide more information on ongoing or upcoming trials.
2. **Off-Label Use:** In some cases, EPI-743 may be prescribed off-label for patients with Leigh disease, particularly those with severe or rapidly progressive disease. However, this approach requires careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks, as well as close monitoring of treatment response and side effects.
3. **Combination Therapy:** Some studies suggest that combining EPI-743 with other therapeutic agents, such as creatine or coenzyme Q10, may enhance its efficacy. Further research is needed to fully explore the potential benefits of combination therapy.

**Recommendations and Next Steps:**

Given the limited availability of effective treatments for Leigh disease, EPI-743 may be considered a potential therapeutic option for the affected son. To determine the best course of action, the following steps are recommended:

1. **Consultation with a Mitochondrial Disease Specialist:** A multidisciplinary team with expertise in mitochondrial disorders should be consulted to discuss the potential benefits and risks of EPI-743 treatment.
2. **Comprehensive Medical Evaluation:** A thorough medical evaluation, including imaging studies and laboratory tests, should be performed to assess the son's disease status and identify potential contraindications to EPI-743 treatment.
3. **Review of Clinical Trial Options:** Researchers and clinicians should be contacted to discuss potential participation in EPI-743 clinical trials or other studies evaluating novel therapeutic agents for Leigh disease.

**Conclusion:**

While EPI-743 may offer hope for patients with Leigh disease, its use should be carefully considered and monitored by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in mitochondrial disorders. A comprehensive medical evaluation, review of clinical trial options, and close collaboration with researchers and clinicians are essential to determining the best course of action for the affected son.",9.0

Genetic testing. My mother in law is in the last stage if lung cancer and only has days to live. My question is...testing her and comparing her tests with my husbands and his sisters test help to determine if it is genetic? My mother in law and her mother and her mothers sister both had lung cancer and none if them were smokers. I'm real worried about my husband getting lung cancer now and I want find out what we can do to protect him.Thank you,"Lung cancer - small cell (Outlook (Prognosis)): How well you do depends on how much the lung cancer has spread. SCLC is very deadly. Not many people with this type of cancer are still alive 5 years after diagnosis. Treatment can often prolong life for 6 to 12 months, even when the cancer has spread. In rare cases, if SCLC is diagnosed early, treatment may result in a long-term cure.","Genetic testing in the context of a familial lung cancer pattern may provide valuable insights for risk assessment and preventive strategies. To determine if lung cancer in your mother-in-law's family is genetically linked, a thorough evaluation of the family history, medical records, and genetic testing would be necessary.

The presence of lung cancer in multiple first- and second-degree relatives on the same side of the family, particularly in the absence of smoking history, raises suspicion for a possible genetic predisposition. Genetic testing can help identify germline mutations in genes known to confer an increased risk of lung cancer. Some of the genes implicated in familial lung cancer include:

1. TP53 (Li-Fraumeni syndrome): Associated with a high risk of multiple cancers, including lung cancer.
2. EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor): Mutations in this gene are more commonly found in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
3. CHEK2: A tumor suppressor gene that, when mutated, may increase the risk of lung cancer.
4. BRCA2: While more commonly associated with breast and ovarian cancer, mutations in this gene may also increase the risk of lung cancer.

Testing your mother-in-law's tumor tissue for genetic mutations may provide valuable information for hereditary cancer risk assessment. However, given her terminal condition and limited time frame, genetic testing might not yield results in time to inform her care.

Comparing genetic test results between your mother-in-law and her children (including your husband and his sisters) may help identify potential inherited mutations. However, it is essential to note that:

1. Genetic testing is not 100% sensitive or specific, and false negatives or false positives can occur.
2. A negative test result does not guarantee that an individual will not develop lung cancer.
3. A positive test result may not necessarily mean that an individual will develop lung cancer, but rather that they may be at increased risk.

To determine the potential benefits of genetic testing for your husband and his sisters, consider the following steps:

1. Consult a genetic counselor or medical geneticist to discuss the family history, potential genetic risks, and the likelihood of identifying a causative mutation.
2. Review medical records and pathology reports for affected family members to gather information on tumor types, stages, and potential genetic alterations.
3. Consider testing your husband and his sisters for known genetic mutations implicated in familial lung cancer, such as TP53, EGFR, CHEK2, and BRCA2.
4. Discuss potential preventive strategies, such as increased surveillance (e.g., annual low-dose computed tomography scans), smoking cessation, and chemoprevention, with a healthcare provider.

In terms of preventive measures for your husband, consider the following:

1. Smoking cessation: Encourage your husband to avoid smoking and secondhand smoke exposure.
2. Environmental risk reduction: Avoid exposure to carcinogens, such as radon and asbestos.
3. Regular medical check-ups: Schedule annual check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor for potential lung cancer symptoms and risk factors.
4. Screening: Discuss the potential benefits and risks of lung cancer screening with a healthcare provider, taking into account your husband's individual risk profile.

Ultimately, a comprehensive evaluation by a genetic counselor or medical geneticist, combined with a thorough review of medical records and family history, will help determine the best course of action for your husband and his sisters.",9.0
Hello i would like more info about Familial Mediterean Fever please as my husband suffers from this. THANKS,"Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (Summary): Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is an inherited condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever. Episodes can begin at any age but most often begin in early childhood. Fevers typically last about 3 weeks but can last from a few days to a few months. The amount of time between episodes may vary from weeks to years. Episodes usually occur spontaneously, but are sometimes brought on by a variety of triggers (such as injury, infection, or stress). Symptoms during fever episodes may include abdominal, muscle or joint pains; skin rashes (usually on the limbs); puffiness around the eyes; and inflammation in various areas of the body. Some people develop amyloidosis. [1] TRAPS is caused by mutations in the TNFRSF1A gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

The clinical presentation of FMF typically involves paroxysmal episodes of high fever (38-40°C), lasting 12-72 hours, often accompanied by painful inflammation of the joints, skin, and abdominal or thoracic cavities. The episodes may be triggered by physical or emotional stress, menstrual periods, or minor infections.

**Diagnostic Criteria**

The Tel-Hashomer criteria are widely used to diagnose FMF:

1. Recurrent febrile episodes (>3) with abdominal, joint, or pleuritic pain.
2. Positive family history of FMF.
3. Response to colchicine therapy.
4. Presence of MEFV gene mutations (although a significant proportion of patients may be mutation-negative).

**MEFV Gene Mutations**

The MEFV gene encodes the pyrin protein, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of the inflammasome complex. Mutations in the MEFV gene lead to the production of a dysfunctional pyrin protein, resulting in uncontrolled activation of the inflammasome and subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

**Treatment Options**

1. **Colchicine**: The first-line treatment for FMF, which reduces the frequency and severity of attacks. The standard dose is 1.2-1.8 mg/day.
2. **Anakinra**: A recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, used in patients with colchicine intolerance or resistance.
3. **Canakinumab**: A monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1β, used in patients with severe FMF and inadequate response to colchicine and anakinra.
4. **Rilonacept**: A fusion protein that inhibits the interaction between interleukin-1 and its receptor, used in patients with inadequate response to colchicine and anakinra.

**Considerations**

1. **Secondary amyloidosis**: A potential long-term complication of chronic inflammation in FMF. Regular monitoring of serum amyloid A levels and kidney function is essential.
2. **Fertility and pregnancy**: Women with FMF should be advised on the risks of complications during pregnancy and the potential benefits of colchicine therapy during this period.
3. **Genetic counseling**: Essential for families with a history of FMF, to discuss the risks of transmission and the availability of genetic testing for family members.

**Monitoring and Follow-up**

Regular follow-up appointments are necessary to monitor disease activity, adjust treatment as needed, and assess for potential complications. Serum amyloid A levels, kidney function, and liver function tests should be performed at regular intervals.",9.0
High Blood Pressure. I know you may not answer this but my blood pressure comes up at night when I am asleep. I take four medicines. I have asked doctors why this happens and no one knows. This morning at four A.M. It was 164 and I took a clonidine to help get it done. It worries me so.,"Preeclampsia (Treatment): Preeclampsia often resolves after the baby is born and the placenta is delivered. However, it may persist or even begin after delivery. Most often, at 37 weeks, your baby is developed enough to be healthy outside of the womb. As a result, your provider will likely want your baby to be delivered so the preeclampsia does not get worse. You may get medicines to help trigger labor, or you may need a C-section. If your baby is not fully developed and you have mild preeclampsia, the disease can often be managed at home until your baby has matured. The provider will recommend: Frequent doctor visits to make sure you and your baby are doing well. Medicines to lower your blood pressure (sometimes). The severity of preeclampsia may change quickly, so you'll need very careful follow-up. Complete bed rest is no longer recommended. Sometimes, a pregnant woman with preeclampsia is admitted to the hospital. This allows the health care team to watch the baby and mother more closely. Treatment in the hospital may include: Close monitoring of the mother and baby Medicines to control blood pressure and prevent seizures and other complications Steroid injections for pregnancies under 34 weeks gestation to help speed up the development of the baby's lungs You and your provider will continue to discuss the safest time to deliver your baby, considering: How close you are to your due date. The severity of the preeclampsia. Preeclampsia has many severe complications that can harm the mother. How well the baby is doing in the womb. The baby must be delivered if there are signs of severe preeclampsia. These include: Tests that show your baby is not growing well or is not getting enough blood and oxygen. The bottom number of your blood pressure is over 110 mm Hg or is greater than 100 mm Hg consistently over a 24-hour period. Abnormal liver function test results. Severe headaches. Pain in the belly area (abdomen). Seizures or changes in mental function (eclampsia). Fluid buildup in the mother's lungs. HELLP syndrome (rare). Low platelet count or bleeding. Low urine output, a lot of protein in the urine, and other signs that your kidneys are not working properly.","Nocturnal hypertension, characterized by elevated blood pressure during sleep, is a recognized phenomenon that can pose significant cardiovascular risks. Despite its importance, the underlying mechanisms and optimal management strategies remain areas of ongoing research.

Several factors may contribute to nocturnal hypertension, including:

1. **Disrupted nocturnal dipping pattern**: Normally, blood pressure decreases by 10-20% during sleep. However, some individuals may exhibit a non-dipping or reverse dipping pattern, where blood pressure remains elevated or increases during sleep.
2. **Sleep disorders**: Sleep apnea, insomnia, and restless leg syndrome can lead to nocturnal hypertension due to sympathetic nervous system activation and disrupted sleep architecture.
3. **Renal function**: Impaired renal function, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease, can contribute to nocturnal hypertension.
4. **Volume overload**: Excess fluid retention, often seen in patients with heart failure or renal disease, can lead to increased nocturnal blood pressure.
5. **Medication non-adherence or inadequate dosing**: Inconsistent or insufficient antihypertensive therapy can result in inadequate blood pressure control, including during sleep.

Given your concomitant use of four antihypertensive medications, it is essential to reassess your treatment regimen and consider potential adjustments. **Clonidine**, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is often used to manage nocturnal hypertension due to its ability to decrease sympathetic outflow and promote vasodilation.

To further address your nocturnal hypertension, consider the following:

1. **Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)**: This 24-hour monitoring system can provide valuable insights into your blood pressure patterns, including nocturnal hypertension.
2. **Sleep study**: A polysomnogram or home sleep apnea test may help identify underlying sleep disorders contributing to nocturnal hypertension.
3. **Renal function assessment**: Evaluate your kidney function through laboratory tests, such as serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
4. **Volume status assessment**: Monitor your fluid status through regular weight checks and consider adjusting your diuretic therapy if necessary.
5. **Medication optimization**: Reassess your antihypertensive regimen with your healthcare provider, considering adjustments to dosing or medication classes to better control nocturnal blood pressure.
6. **Lifestyle modifications**: Encourage healthy lifestyle habits, such as regular exercise, weight management, and stress reduction techniques, to help mitigate nocturnal hypertension.

In addition to clonidine, other medications that may be effective in managing nocturnal hypertension include:

1. **Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists**: Spironolactone or eplerenone can help reduce nocturnal blood pressure by mitigating volume overload and sympathetic nervous system activity.
2. **Beta-blockers**: Certain beta-blockers, such as carvedilol or nebivolol, have been shown to reduce nocturnal blood pressure.
3. **Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**: These medications may help reduce nocturnal blood pressure by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

Collaborate with your healthcare provider to develop a comprehensive treatment plan addressing your nocturnal hypertension and reassess your antihypertensive regimen as needed.",9.0

If canker sores persist or continue to return, tests should be done to look for other causes, such as erythema multiforme, drug allergies, herpes infection, and bullous lichen planus. You may need further testing or a biopsy to look for other causes of mouth ulcers. Canker sores are not cancer and do not cause cancer. There are types of cancer, however, that may first appear as a mouth ulcer that does not heal.","**Management of Recurrent Aphthous Ulcers**

Recurrent aphthous ulcers (RAU), also known as canker sores, can significantly impact an individual's quality of life. Given the high frequency of ulcer recurrence in your case, a comprehensive approach is necessary to address the underlying etiologies and develop an effective treatment plan.

**Etiological Considerations**

Several factors may contribute to the development of RAU, including:

1. **Mucosal trauma**: Minor injuries, such as those caused by dental work, oral surgery, or accidental biting, can trigger the formation of ulcers.
2. **Genetic predisposition**: Family history and genetic factors can play a role in the development of RAU.
3. **Immunological factors**: Deficiencies in the immune system, such as those seen in conditions like Behçet's disease or celiac disease, can increase the risk of RAU.
4. **Nutritional deficiencies**: Inadequate intake of essential nutrients, including vitamin B12, iron, and folic acid, can contribute to RAU.
5. **Hormonal changes**: Fluctuations in hormone levels, particularly during menstruation or menopause, can trigger ulcer formation.

**Treatment Options**

To effectively manage RAU, a combination of the following treatments may be employed:

1. **Topical corticosteroids**: Application of topical corticosteroids, such as triamcinolone acetonide or fluocinonide, can help reduce inflammation and promote healing.
2. **Antimicrobial therapy**: Topical antibiotics, such as tetracycline or minocycline, may be used to prevent secondary infection.
3. **Pain management**: Topical anesthetics, such as lidocaine or benzocaine, can provide symptomatic relief.
4. **Caustic agents**: Application of caustic agents, like silver nitrate or potassium nitrate, can help debride the ulcer and promote healing.
5. **Laser therapy**: Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been shown to reduce pain and promote healing in RAU.

**Systemic Therapies**

In cases of severe or recurrent RAU, systemic therapies may be necessary:

1. **Colchicine**: This anti-inflammatory agent has been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of RAU.
2. **Dapsone**: This antibiotic has anti-inflammatory properties and can be effective in managing RAU.
3. **Systemic corticosteroids**: Short-term use of systemic corticosteroids may be necessary to control severe inflammation.

**Lifestyle Modifications**

To help manage RAU and prevent recurrence, consider the following lifestyle modifications:

1. **Maintain good oral hygiene**: Regular brushing and flossing can help prevent mucosal trauma and reduce the risk of secondary infection.
2. **Avoid irritants**: Avoid spicy or acidic foods, as well as sharp or rough objects that can cause mucosal trauma.
3. **Stress management**: Stress can exacerbate RAU; engaging in stress-reducing activities, such as meditation or yoga, can help mitigate this effect.
4. **Nutritional supplementation**: Ensure adequate intake of essential nutrients, including vitamin B12, iron, and folic acid.

**Conclusion**

The management of RAU requires a comprehensive approach, incorporating both topical and systemic therapies, as well as lifestyle modifications. It is essential to work with a healthcare provider to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses the underlying etiologies and promotes effective management of this condition.",9.0
How to Stop Snoring. How to Stop Snoring,"Snoring (Lifestyle and home remedies): To prevent or quiet snoring, try these tips: - If you're overweight, lose weight. People who are overweight may have extra tissues in the throat that contribute to snoring. Losing weight can help reduce snoring. - Sleep on your side. Lying on your back allows your tongue to fall backward into your throat, narrowing your airway and partially obstructing airflow. Try sleeping on your side. If you find that you always end up on your back in the middle of the night, try sewing a tennis ball in the back of your pajama top. - Raise the head of your bed. Raising the head of your bed by about 4 inches may help. - Nasal strips or an external nasal dilator. Adhesive strips applied to the bridge of the nose help many people increase the area of their nasal passage, enhancing their breathing. A nasal dilator is a stiffened adhesive strip applied externally across the nostrils that may help decrease airflow resistance so you breathe easier. Nasal strips and external nasal dilators aren't effective for people with OSA, however. - Treat nasal congestion or obstruction. Having allergies or a deviated septum can limit airflow through your nose. This forces you to breathe through your mouth, increasing the likelihood of snoring. Ask your doctor about a prescription steroid spray if you have chronic congestion. To correct a structural defect in your airway, such as a deviated septum, you may need surgery. - Limit or avoid alcohol and sedatives. Avoid drinking alcoholic beverages at least two hours before bedtime, and let your doctor know about your snoring before taking sedatives. Sedatives and alcohol depress your central nervous system, causing excessive relaxation of muscles, including the tissues in your throat. - Quit smoking. Smoking cessation may reduce snoring, in addition to having numerous other health benefits. - Get enough sleep. Adults should aim for at least seven hours of sleep per night. The recommended hours of sleep for children vary by age. Preschool-aged children should get 10 to 13 hours a day. School-age children need nine to 12 hours a day, and teens should have eight to 10 hours a day.","Snoring is a common problem affecting approximately 40% of adults, with 24% of men and 17% of women experiencing habitual snoring. Snoring is a manifestation of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or a separate entity, known as primary snoring. Effective management of snoring requires a comprehensive approach, addressing both lifestyle modifications and potential surgical interventions.

**Lifestyle Modifications**

1. **Weight Loss**: A reduction in body mass index (BMI) can significantly decrease snoring severity, as excess weight can lead to increased fat deposition around the airway, exacerbating obstruction.
2. **Sleep Position**: Encourage patients to adopt a lateral sleep position using a body pillow or a device that prevents supine sleeping. This can help reduce the likelihood of airway obstruction.
3. **Avoid Sedatives and Alcohol**: Both sedatives and alcohol can relax the upper airway muscles, leading to increased collapsibility and snoring. Advise patients to avoid these substances before bedtime.
4. **Smoking Cessation**: Smoking can cause inflammation and swelling in the upper airway, contributing to snoring. Encourage smoking cessation to reduce snoring severity.

**Medical Interventions**

1. **Oral Appliances**: Mandibular advancement devices (MADs) and tongue-retaining devices (TRDs) can help maintain patency of the upper airway during sleep, reducing snoring severity.
2. **Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)**: CPAP is the gold standard treatment for OSA. By maintaining a constant flow of air pressure through the upper airway, CPAP can prevent collapse and reduce snoring.
3. **Nasal Decongestants and Saline Irrigation**: Nasal congestion can exacerbate snoring. Recommend nasal decongestants and saline irrigation to alleviate nasal congestion.

**Surgical Interventions**

1. **Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP)**: UPPP involves surgical removal of the uvula and part of the soft palate to widen the upper airway. This procedure can be effective in reducing snoring severity in select patients.
2. **Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA)**: RFA involves using radiofrequency energy to shrink the size of the soft palate and uvula, reducing snoring severity.
3. **Turbinate Reduction**: Turbinate bones can cause nasal obstruction, leading to increased snoring severity. Turbinate reduction surgery can help alleviate nasal congestion and reduce snoring.

**Considerations**

1. **OSA Screening**: All patients presenting with snoring should undergo OSA screening using polysomnography (PSG) or home sleep testing (HST).
2. **Upper Airway Evaluation**: Perform a comprehensive upper airway evaluation to identify anatomical abnormalities contributing to snoring.
3. **Dental Evaluation**: Patients with MADs or TRDs should undergo a dental evaluation to ensure proper fit and to monitor for potential complications.

In conclusion, effective management of snoring requires a multidisciplinary approach, addressing lifestyle modifications, medical interventions, and surgical interventions. A thorough evaluation, including OSA screening and upper airway assessment, is essential to develop a personalized treatment plan.",9.0
I have exercise induced asthma. Would any of these non drug devises be suitable please?,"Exercise-induced asthma (Symptoms): Signs and symptoms of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction may begin during or a few minutes after exercise, and they may persist for 30 minutes or longer if left untreated. The signs and symptoms may include: - Coughing - Wheezing - Shortness of breath - Chest tightness or pain - Fatigue during exercise - Poorer than expected athletic performance - Feeling out of shape even when you're in good physical shape - Avoidance of activity (a sign primarily among young children) When to see a doctor See your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Because a number of conditions can cause similar symptoms, it's important to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis. Get emergency medical treatment if you have worsening symptoms: - Shortness of breath or wheezing that is quickly getting worse - No improvement even after using a prescription inhaler for asthma attacks","Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) or exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) is a condition characterized by airway constriction and symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath during or after physical exertion. Non-pharmacological interventions can be considered complementary or adjunctive treatments. 

Several non-drug devices are available for managing EIA. One option is the use of a mask or device that warms and humidifies the air before it enters the lungs. The AirTurbo, a device that uses electrical resistance to heat the air, has been shown to reduce symptoms of EIA in some patients. Similarly, the use of a face mask that warms and humidifies the air, such as the AsthmaAid or the Heat and Moisture Exchanger (HME), may also be beneficial.

Another device, the InCourage SpiroTiger, uses a resistive load and biofeedback to help improve lung function and reduce symptoms of EIA. However, there is limited research supporting its efficacy in managing EIA.

The use of nasal filters, such as those containing electrostatic charges, may also help reduce symptoms of EIA. These filters can capture allergens and pollutants, which can trigger EIA in some individuals. However, more research is needed to confirm their effectiveness in managing EIA.

It is essential to note that while these devices may be beneficial in managing EIA, they should not replace pharmacological treatments or be used as the sole treatment. Medications such as bronchodilators and corticosteroids remain the primary treatment options for EIA. Additionally, these devices may not be suitable for all patients, particularly those with severe EIA or concomitant respiratory conditions.

Before using any non-drug devices, patients should consult their healthcare provider to discuss the potential benefits and limitations of these devices in managing their specific condition. A thorough assessment of the patient's medical history, lung function, and symptoms is necessary to determine the most effective treatment plan. Furthermore, patients should be educated on proper device use and maintenance to ensure optimal outcomes.

In conclusion, while non-drug devices may be considered as adjunctive treatments for EIA, they should not replace pharmacological treatments. A comprehensive treatment plan, including lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions, should be developed in consultation with a healthcare provider to manage EIA effectively.",9.0

This imbalance leads to abnormal pain processing and transmission in the trigeminal nerve pathway.

The proposed treatment involves a multi-faceted approach that targets these underlying mechanisms:

1. **Pharmacological Interventions**: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) may be effective in modulating the serotonin and dopamine levels, which can help alleviate pain and discomfort. Additionally, low-dose anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin, may be prescribed to reduce neuropathic pain.

2. **Topical Agents**: Capsaicin, a natural analgesic, has been shown to reduce pain in BMS patients by desensitizing nociceptors. Topical capsaicin formulations may be applied to the affected areas to provide relief.

3. **Nerve Stimulation Therapies**: Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may be employed to modulate pain pathways and reduce BMS symptoms.

4. **Behavioral and Psychological Interventions**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and relaxation techniques, such as mindfulness meditation and yoga, may be beneficial in managing stress and anxiety, which can exacerbate BMS symptoms.

5. **Alternative and Complementary Therapies**: Acupuncture and herbal supplements, such as St. John's Wort and alpha-lipoic acid, may be explored as adjunctive treatments to alleviate BMS symptoms.

Regarding the availability of these treatments, it is essential to note that our research is still in the experimental stage, and further studies are necessary to confirm the efficacy and safety of these interventions. We are currently conducting clinical trials to test the effectiveness of these treatments in BMS patients.

In the meantime, we recommend that BMS patients work closely with their healthcare providers to explore available treatment options and develop a personalized management plan. This may involve a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, as well as lifestyle modifications, such as maintaining good oral hygiene, avoiding spicy or irritating foods, and managing stress.

As our research progresses, we will continue to update the medical community and BMS support groups on the availability of effective treatments for this condition. We appreciate the interest and enthusiasm from the BMS community and are committed to developing meaningful solutions to alleviate the suffering associated with this condition.",9.0

Hypertension and fibromyalgia are two distinct conditions that often coexist, presenting a complex clinical challenge. Fibromyalgia, a chronic pain syndrome characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and cognitive impairment, affects approximately 2-4% of the general population. Hypertension, a major cardiovascular risk factor, is prevalent in 30-40% of individuals with fibromyalgia.

**Pathophysiological Mechanisms**

The relationship between hypertension and fibromyalgia is bidirectional. Fibromyalgia patients often experience chronic stress, anxiety, and sleep disturbances, which can contribute to the development of hypertension. Conversely, hypertension may exacerbate fibromyalgia symptoms, such as pain and fatigue, through various mechanisms:

1. **Neuroendocrine Alterations**: Fibromyalgia patients often exhibit dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to increased cortisol levels, which can contribute to hypertension.
2. **Sympathetic Hyperactivity**: Fibromyalgia patients frequently demonstrate increased sympathetic nervous system activity, resulting in elevated blood pressure and heart rate.
3. **Vasopressin and Oxytocin Imbalance**: Fibromyalgia patients may exhibit altered levels of these hormones, which play a crucial role in regulating blood pressure and cardiovascular function.

**Clinical Considerations**

When managing hypertension in patients with fibromyalgia, it is essential to consider the following:

1. **Comprehensive Assessment**: Evaluate the patient's overall cardiovascular risk profile, including lipid profile, glucose metabolism, and kidney function.
2. **Antihypertensive Therapy**: Select antihypertensive agents that are effective in managing hypertension while minimizing potential adverse effects on fibromyalgia symptoms. For example:
	* ACE inhibitors or ARBs may be beneficial due to their potential to reduce sympathetic activity and improve cardiovascular outcomes.
	* Beta-blockers may be useful in patients with comorbid anxiety or sleep disturbances.
	* Calcium channel blockers may be effective in patients with comorbid Raynaud's phenomenon.
3. **Fibromyalgia Management**: Optimize fibromyalgia treatment to reduce symptoms that may exacerbate hypertension, such as pain and fatigue. This may involve:
	* Multimodal analgesia, including acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and opioids.
	* Antidepressants, such as SSRIs or SNRIs, to address pain, fatigue, and mood disturbances.
	* Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and stress management techniques to address psychological factors.
4. **Lifestyle Interventions**: Encourage patients to adopt a healthy lifestyle, including regular physical activity, stress management, and a balanced diet, to help manage both hypertension and fibromyalgia.

**Conclusion**

The relationship between hypertension and fibromyalgia is complex, with bidirectional interactions between the two conditions. A comprehensive approach to management, including antihypertensive therapy, fibromyalgia treatment, and lifestyle interventions, is essential to optimize outcomes for patients with both conditions.",9.0
Jaundice. Can older infants get jaundice? What is the age range?,Gilbert syndrome (Causes): Gilbert syndrome affects 1 in 10 people in some white groups.,"Jaundice in Older Infants: Age Range and Clinical Considerations

Jaundice, characterized by an elevated serum bilirubin level, is a common condition in neonates. While typically associated with newborns, jaundice can also occur in older infants. The age range for jaundice in infants can be divided into several categories:

1. **Physiological jaundice**: Typically occurs in the first 2-3 weeks of life, peaking around 3-5 days. However, it can persist or present later in some cases, particularly in breastfed infants or those with underlying conditions.
2. **Breast milk jaundice**: Presents in the first 2-4 weeks, with a peak around 7-10 days. This condition is more common in breastfed infants and may persist for 2-3 months.
3. **Pathological jaundice**: Can occur at any age, including in older infants, and is often caused by underlying conditions such as hemolytic disease, liver disease, or biliary atresia.

In older infants (beyond 3-4 months), jaundice is often a sign of an underlying pathological condition. Some possible causes include:

* **Biliary atresia**: A congenital condition where the bile ducts are blocked or absent, leading to jaundice and liver damage.
* **Hemolytic disease**: Conditions such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency or hereditary spherocytosis can cause hemolysis and jaundice.
* **Liver disease**: Conditions like alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency or Alagille syndrome can cause liver dysfunction and jaundice.
* **Infections**: Viral or bacterial infections, such as hepatitis or urinary tract infections, can cause jaundice in older infants.

When evaluating an older infant with jaundice, it is essential to consider the following:

* **Differential diagnosis**: Perform a thorough medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests to rule out underlying conditions.
* **Laboratory tests**: Order total and direct bilirubin levels, complete blood count, reticulocyte count, and liver function tests to determine the cause of jaundice.
* **Imaging studies**: Consider ultrasound or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to evaluate the liver and bile ducts.

Treatment options for jaundice in older infants depend on the underlying cause:

* **Phototherapy**: May be effective for mild cases of jaundice, particularly if caused by breast milk jaundice.
* **Exchange transfusion**: May be necessary for severe cases of hemolytic disease or biliary atresia.
* **Surgical intervention**: May be required for conditions like biliary atresia or liver disease.
* **Medications**: May be prescribed to treat underlying conditions, such as antibiotics for infections or medications to manage hemolytic disease.

In conclusion, jaundice can occur in older infants, and a thorough evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause. A comprehensive diagnostic workup and timely intervention can significantly impact outcomes in these patients.",9.0

Lung cancer treatment has undergone significant advancements in recent years, with the emergence of targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and combination regimens. For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common subtype, treatment options are often tailored based on the tumor's molecular profile, stage, and patient performance status.

**Pemetrexed (Almita)**

Pemetrexed is a folate analog antimetabolite, approved for the treatment of pleural mesothelioma and NSCLC. It works by inhibiting thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase, leading to DNA damage and apoptosis in rapidly dividing cancer cells.

**Treatment Considerations for Pemetrexed**

Prior to initiating pemetrexed, patients should undergo the following:

1. **Renal function assessment**: Pemetrexed is primarily excreted by the kidneys; therefore, a baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl) assessment is necessary. Patients with CrCl <45 mL/min may require dose adjustments.
2. **Vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation**: To minimize the risk of severe hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities, patients should receive vitamin B12 injections (1000 mcg IM) and oral folic acid supplementation (350-1000 mcg) for at least 7 days prior to the first pemetrexed dose.
3. **Complete blood counts (CBC)**: Baseline CBC evaluation is essential to monitor for potential hematologic toxicities, such as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.
4. **Liver function tests**: Baseline liver function tests (LFTs) are necessary to assess for potential hepatic toxicity.

**Pemetrexed Administration and Monitoring**

1. **Dose and administration**: Pemetrexed is administered at a dose of 500 mg/m² IV over 10 minutes on day 1 of a 21-day cycle.
2. **Monitoring**: Patients should be closely monitored for signs of hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities, including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
3. **Dose adjustments**: Dose adjustments may be necessary based on the severity of toxicities and renal function.

**Other Treatment Options and Considerations**

1. **Targeted therapies**: Depending on the tumor's molecular profile, targeted therapies such as EGFR inhibitors (e.g., erlotinib, gefitinib), ALK inhibitors (e.g., crizotinib), or BRAF inhibitors (e.g., dabrafenib) may be considered.
2. **Immunotherapies**: Immunotherapies, such as pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or atezolizumab, may be considered in patients with tumors expressing high levels of PD-L1.
3. **Combination regimens**: Combination regimens, such as platinum-based chemotherapy with pemetrexed or bevacizumab, may be considered based on the tumor's molecular profile and patient performance status.

**Additional Recommendations**

1. **Multidisciplinary care**: A multidisciplinary team, including medical oncologists, pulmonologists, and thoracic surgeons, should be involved in the patient's care to ensure comprehensive management.
2. **Palliative care**: Palliative care services should be considered to address the patient's physical, emotional, and social needs.
3. **Genetic counseling**: Genetic counseling may be necessary to discuss the potential risks and benefits of genetic testing and targeted therapies.

In conclusion, pemetrexed is a viable treatment option for patients with NSCLC, particularly those with advanced disease. However, careful consideration of the patient's molecular profile, renal function, and performance status is necessary to optimize treatment outcomes.",9.0

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune disorder characterized by production of autoantibodies and deposition of immune complexes, leading to inflammation and damage in multiple organs. The etiology of SLE is multifactorial, involving genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors.

**Clinical Presentation**

SLE can manifest with a wide range of symptoms, including:

1. Malar rash (butterfly-shaped rash on the face)
2. Discoid rash (coin-shaped lesions on the skin)
3. Photosensitivity
4. Arthritis (non-erosive)
5. Serositis (pleuritis, pericarditis)
6. Renal involvement (nephritis, nephrotic syndrome)
7. Neurological symptoms (seizures, psychosis)
8. Hematological abnormalities (anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia)

**Diagnostic Criteria**

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) have established criteria for SLE diagnosis, which include:

1. Immunologic criteria (ANA positivity, anti-dsDNA antibodies)
2. Clinical criteria (malar rash, discoid rash, photosensitivity, etc.)

**Treatment Considerations**

Treatment of SLE aims to control symptoms, prevent organ damage, and minimize adverse effects of therapy.

1. **Non-pharmacological interventions**: Lifestyle modifications (sun protection, stress management), patient education, and physical therapy.
2. **Pharmacological interventions**:
	* **NSAIDs**: For mild symptoms (arthritis, serositis).
	* **Corticosteroids**: For moderate to severe symptoms (oral prednisone or methylprednisolone).
	* **Antimalarials**: For skin and joint symptoms (hydroxychloroquine).
	* **Immunosuppressives**: For severe or refractory disease (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil).
	* **Biologics**: For severe or refractory disease (rituximab, belimumab).
3. **Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs)**: For patients with persistent disease activity, DMARDs may be used as adjunctive therapy.
4. **Organ-Specific Treatment**:
	* **Renal involvement**: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertension and proteinuria.
	* **Neurological symptoms**: Anticonvulsants for seizures and antipsychotics for psychosis.

**Treatment Monitoring and Adjustments**

Regular monitoring of disease activity, organ function, and treatment side effects is essential to adjust therapy and prevent complications.

1. **Disease activity**: Assess using SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) scores.
2. **Organ function**: Monitor renal function (serum creatinine, urinalysis), liver function, and hematological parameters.
3. **Treatment side effects**: Monitor for corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis, glaucoma, and cataracts.

**Special Considerations**

1. **Pregnancy**: SLE patients require close monitoring and adjustment of therapy during pregnancy.
2. **Infection risk**: SLE patients are at increased risk of infections, particularly with immunosuppressive therapy.
3. **Malignancy risk**: SLE patients have an increased risk of certain malignancies, such as lymphoma.

In conclusion, SLE is a complex disease requiring a comprehensive treatment approach. A multidisciplinary team, including rheumatologists, nephrologists, and other specialists, should be involved in managing SLE patients. Regular monitoring and adjustments of therapy are crucial to prevent complications and optimize outcomes.",9.0
"Medical Diagnosis of Asbestosis. My doctors hint that I have asbestosis but do not say I have asbestosis. All the medical information that I have read from the CDC, Medlin and NIH all say that the symptoms presented are related to a high level of asbestos. Why won't the doctor say it?","Screen time and children: ""Screen time"" is a term used for activities done in front of a screen, such as watching TV, working on a computer, or playing video games. Screen time is sedentary activity, meaning you are being physically inactive while sitting down. Very little energy is used during screen time. Most American children spend about 3 hours a day watching TV. Added together, all types of screen time can total 5 to 7 hours a day. Too much screen time can: Make it hard for your child to sleep at night Raise your child's risk for attention problems, anxiety, and depression Raise your child's risk for gaining too much weight (obesity) Screen time increases your child's risk for obesity because: Sitting and watching a screen is time that is not spent being physically active. TV commercials and other screen ads can lead to unhealthy food choices. Most of the time, the foods in ads that are aimed at kids are high in sugar, salt, or fats. Children eat more when they are watching TV, especially if they see ads for food. Computers can help kids with their schoolwork. But surfing the internet, spending too much time on Facebook, or watching YouTube videos is considered unhealthy screen time. Children under age 2 should have no screen time. Limit screen time to 1 to 2 hours a day for children over age 2. Despite what ads may say, videos that are aimed at very young children do not improve their development. Cutting down to 2 hours a day can be hard for some children because TV may be such a large part of their daily routines. But you can help your children by telling them how sedentary activities affect their overall health. Talk to them about things they can do to be healthier. To decrease screen time: Remove the TV or computer from your child's bedroom. DO NOT allow TV watching during meals or homework. DO NOT let your child eat while watching TV or using the computer. DO NOT leave the TV on for background noise. Turn on the radio instead, or have no background noise. Decide which programs to watch ahead of time. Turn off the TV when those programs are over. Suggest other activities, such as family board games, puzzles, or going for a walk. Keep a record of how much time is spent in front of a screen. Try to spend the same amount of time being active. Be a good role model as a parent. Decrease your own screen time to 2 hours a day. If it is hard not having the TV on, try using a sleep function so it turns off automatically. Challenge your family to go 1 week without watching TV or doing other screen-time activities. Find things to do with your time that get you moving and burning energy. Updated by: Liora C. Adler, MD, Pediatric Emergency Medicine, Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital, Hollywood, FL. Review provided by VeriMed Healthcare Network. Also reviewed by David Zieve, MD, MHA, Medical Director, Brenda Conaway, Editorial Director, and the A.D.A.M. Editorial team.","The diagnosis of asbestosis can be complex and multifactorial, often requiring a comprehensive evaluation of clinical, radiological, and occupational history. The reluctance of doctors to conclusively diagnose asbestosis may be attributed to several factors.

Asbestosis is a chronic lung disease caused by the inhalation of asbestos fibers, leading to fibrosis and inflammation in the lungs. The diagnostic criteria for asbestosis include a history of asbestos exposure, symptoms such as dyspnea and cough, and characteristic radiographic findings.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Medline, and National Institutes of Health (NIH) acknowledge that asbestos exposure is a significant risk factor for developing asbestosis. However, the diagnostic process involves a nuanced interpretation of clinical and radiological findings.

A definitive diagnosis of asbestosis typically requires:

1. **Established asbestos exposure**: A thorough occupational and environmental history to confirm exposure to asbestos.
2. **Characteristic radiographic findings**: Chest radiographs (CXR) or high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans demonstrating bilateral lower lobe predominant fibrosis, often with a reticular or nodular pattern.
3. **Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)**: Showing a restrictive pattern, with a decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).
4. **Clinical symptoms**: Presence of respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and chest tightness.

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommend a comprehensive evaluation, including a detailed medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing, to establish a diagnosis of asbestosis.

Possible reasons for the hesitation in diagnosing asbestosis include:

1. **Differential diagnosis**: Other conditions, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), may present with similar symptoms and radiographic findings, making it essential to rule out alternative diagnoses.
2. **Variability in asbestos exposure**: The intensity and duration of asbestos exposure can vary significantly, influencing the likelihood of developing asbestosis.
3. **Radiographic interpretation**: The interpretation of radiographic findings can be subjective, and the presence of asbestos-related pleural disease or other lung conditions may complicate the diagnosis.
4. **Medico-legal implications**: A diagnosis of asbestosis may have significant medico-legal implications, including potential liability for asbestos exposure and compensation claims.

To facilitate an accurate diagnosis, it is essential to:

1. **Provide detailed occupational and environmental history**: Inform your doctor about your asbestos exposure, including the duration, intensity, and type of asbestos involved.
2. **Undergo comprehensive diagnostic testing**: Ensure that you have undergone all recommended diagnostic tests, including CXR, HRCT, PFTs, and clinical evaluation.
3. **Seek a specialist opinion**: Consult a pulmonologist or an occupational medicine specialist with expertise in asbestos-related diseases to provide a comprehensive evaluation and diagnosis.

By understanding the complexities involved in diagnosing asbestosis, patients can better navigate the diagnostic process and work collaboratively with their healthcare providers to establish an accurate diagnosis and develop an effective management plan.",8.0
